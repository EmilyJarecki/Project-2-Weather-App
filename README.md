## Project Description
<br/>

- Our project is a weather app which uses [Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), which detects the weather of the user's current location. Once the user allows the app to detect their location, it shows weather details that are updated hourly. The app also displays a small forecast for the following six days, making the app an automatic 7-day forecast. It displays the date and the weather conditions expected for each day. There is a link embedded in the weekly forecast that takes them to a new page with a more in-depth reading of the 7-day forecast, including all of the details mentioned on the first page. 
<br/>
<br/>

- Our motivation was to create a personalized weather app that does not require a user to have to manually input their location and which provides weather data that is not superfluous, only that which is necessary. 
<br/>
<br/>

- The following is detected and displayed upon accepting geolocation: 
    -   The day of the week
    -   Current temperature
    -   The time
    -   Feels like temperature
    -   High and low temperatures for the day
    -   Sunrise and sunset times
    -   Wind speed and direction
    -   Weathercode, which displays weather conditions

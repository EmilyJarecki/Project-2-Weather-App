- [ ]  **Description:** Describe at a high level what your project is and the motivation for the project (*i.e.*, what problem(s) your projects solves) and includes a **screenshot** of the application in the browser.
<br/>
<br/>
- Our project is a weather app which uses Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API(https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)which detects the weather of the users current location. Once the users allows the app to detect their location, it shows details updated hourly. 
<br/>
<br/>
What problems does it solve?
- Our motivation was to create a personalized weather app that does not require a user to have to manually input their location and which provides weather data that is not superfluous, only that which is necessary. 
<br/>
The following is detected: 
-   The day of the week
-   Time
-   Current temperature
-   Feels like temperature
-   High and low temperature for the day
-   Sunrise and Sunset 
-   Wind speed and direction
-   Weathercode 
- It also shows a small forecast for the following six days, making the app an automatic 7-day forecast. It displayed the date and the weather code expected for each. There is a link embedded in the weekly forecast which takes them to a new page that gives a more in-depth reading of the 7-day forecast, including all of the details mentioned on the first page.
